# UEFI Basic
A simple BASIC language intepreter that runs on UEFI. Feel free to submit a pull request.
## Requirements
The gcc compiler for x64\_64 mingw platform (x86\_64-w64-mingw32-gcc).
## Compilation
Running `make` will produce an EFI file and a bootable ISO for the x86\_64 architechture.
## Usage
Programs need to be typed in with line numbers. To run use the `run` command, and to create a new program use the `new` command. `list` prints out the current program.
